* Reason
I created this project to explore rate of improvement over time at speedrunning SM64.

I wanted to see if a structured approach to learning could reduce time spent learning and practicing.

* Technologies
App is built using Svelte + Tailwindcss.

svelte [[https://github.com/Rich-Harris/pancake][pancake]] library was used for the data visualisation.

Data was obtained through [[https://speedrun.com][speedrun.com]] APIs in early January 2022.
